The project successfully predicted different levels of PM2.5 particulate matter concentra
tion in the air for some locations in Uganda. Out of the various machine learning models
used in the project XGB classifier algorithm showed significant improvement in accuracy
of 75%.
This model may assist stakeholders, decision-makers and researchers in rapid seismic r
isk assessment in order to formulate and implement new plans and policies in PM2.5 co
ncentration in the air in Uganda. Further investigation should be carried out for a better
understanding of the applicability of the machine learning model in PM2.5 concentration
prediction based on the need and interests of the decision-makers and researchers.
